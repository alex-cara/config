Certain configs that I enjoy using.
Neovim, kitty (the terminal emulator), sway and dwm is the currently used Tiling WM, for Wayland and X11 respectively.
Largest thing is the setbg script which is focused on sway, sets the background and makes sway colors reflect the image
using pywal, the rest are keybind/plugin choices. For kitty setbg also updates terminal colors.
